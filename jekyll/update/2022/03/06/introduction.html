    <p>The Stern-Gerlach experiment, performed in 1922 by Walther Gerlach after its conception by Otto Stern the year prior, demonstrated the quantization of angular momentum. It consisted of a collimated beam of silver atoms that was sent through a perpendicular, inhomogenous magnetic field.</p>

<p>A particle moving through space possesses an (orbital) angular velocity, expressed as the following vector cross product:</p>

\[L = r x p\]

<p>where r, p are the position vector and the momentum respectively.</p>

<p>When describing a <em>charged</em> particle’s motion, it has a corresponding <em>dipole moment</em>, which is measured by the strength of the resultant magnetic field. It is given by:</p>

\[{mu}_L = qL/2m\]

<p>Since the magnetic field was specifically inhomogeneous, say, directed in the z-direction: it will cause the particles to <em>precess</em> about the z-axis, and exert a force:</p>

\[F_z = {mu}*∂B/∂z\]

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Classically, the expression {mu}_z =</td>
      <td>{mu}</td>
      <td>*cos({theta}) indicates that one might expect a continuous range of values after the atoms are projected. Silver has an atomic number of 47. 46 of its electrons form a closed shell about its nucleus, and atomic theory dictates that the magnetic moment of a silver atom is essentially due to the magnetic moment exhibited by its single valence electron.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>However, only <em>two</em> discrete values were observed. This “intrinsic” angular momentum refers to a particulate-level phenomenon known as “spin”.</p>

<p>There were four subsequent experiments conducted after this first one, involving multiple Stern-Gerlach apparatuses.</p>

<p>The First Experiment: 
In the first experiment, two identical Stern-Gerlach devices were placed in a row. After the collimated beam passes through the first device, it evenly splits into “spin-up” and “spin-down” polarities (positive and negative respectively). Then, if the particles with positive spin were sent into the second device, the observed effect was not the two discrete values as in the first experiment, rather, it was that only the positive-spin particles were emitted, as if the machine “preserved” polarity of spin.</p>

<p>The Second Experiment: 
In the second experiment, two Stern-Gerlach devices were once again employed, except the latter one would have a polarization different from the first (for example: the first one z-polarized, the second one x-polarized). When the beam passes through the first machine, it separated into spin-up and spin-down rays, with respect to the z-direction. Now, only the spin-up beam gets sent into the second, x-oriented Stern-Gerlach machine. The observed result is that the z-machine has no effect on the output of the x-orientation: the spin-up beam splits into equally-partitioned spin-up and spin-down beams, except now polarized in the x-direction. In other words, these orthogonal orientations are seemingly independent.</p>

<p>The Third Experiment: 
Now, three Stern-Gerlach devices were</p>
